# Reading Comprehension Assessment Toy Kits

## Playground
### Components
#### Lock and Keys
Real locks and keys will be used for this.
#### Robots
Two robots, one red and one blue. Real batteries will be used so robot size should be approximate. Robots *can* have a hollow belly, but batteries do not need to be able to snap inside.
#### Go Carts
Two Go Carts and 6 wheels. They do not have to assemble exactly as they will be seen in the story.
#### Swing
Can be just a plastic rectangular prism with two holes, as real string will be used for this.
#### Tents
Testing will be easier if these are made with 3 sticks held together well. Real cloth and scissors will be used for the rest.

1. Locks and 3 keys (We'll use real locks and keys for this one)
2. Robots (Red and Blue) - We can use real batteries so size of robot should be approximate.  The robots can have a hollow belly like in the story but batteries do not need to snap inside.
3. 2 Go Carts and 6 wheels - And like above they do NOT have to assemble exactly as they will see them in the story.
4. The Swing can just be a plastic rectangular prism with two holes.  We'll use real string for this.
5. 2 Tents - If there were created with 3 sticks and held together well that will make testing much easier.  We'll use real cloth and scissors.

## Treasure Hunt
### Components
#### Kids
Two kids needed, Jada and Jaxon. They should look as much like in the video as possible.
#### Pirate hats
Two pirate hats appropriately sized for the Jada and Jaxon figures.
#### Rowboats
Two rowboats and four oars are needed.
#### Flashlights
Real flashlights and batteries will be used for this.
#### Vine
Real string will be used for this.
#### Energy bars
Would be preferable if these were able to interlock and break apart easily, almost like legos.
